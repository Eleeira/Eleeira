<p>Hi There! I'm Adina, ðŸ‘‹ </p>
<p> // but you can call me Eleeira, you know it's kinda an informal name!// </p>

<p> I'm 32 and my geek addiction led me here, lol. </p>
<p> I live with computers since I was 5, and like every real best friend does, they never - never EVER never- disappoint me. I'd like to describe myself as a self-tought web expert because knowledge must always be joined with practice. </p>
